/// Annotation to indicate an API is only implemented on specific platforms.
///
/// Use this when an API has shipped for a subset of platforms, but is not yet
/// available everywhere.
///
/// The annotated API should **not** throw unsupported exception:
/// - For fields/properties: the value will always be `null` or handled by the plugin.
/// - For methods: the call will be ignored, skipped, or handled by the plugin.
///
/// Callers can check the current platform to decide whether to rely on the
/// returned data or to present alternative UX.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```dart
/// @AvailableOn([HealthPlatform.android, HealthPlatform.appleHealth])
/// Future<Metadata> loadMetadata();
/// ```
