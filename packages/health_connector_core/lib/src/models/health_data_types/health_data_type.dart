/// [HealthDataType] represents different kinds of health and fitness data
/// that can be read from or written to health platforms.
///
/// ## Type Parameters
///
/// - `R`: The [HealthRecord] type associated with this data type
/// - `U`: The unit type for aggregations (e.g., [Numeric], [Mass], [Energy])
///
/// ## Capability Model Design
///
/// This class uses **interface classes** instead of mixins to represent
/// capabilities reading, writing, aggregation).
///
/// ### Why Not Mixins?
///
/// Initially, capabilities were implemented using `base mixin`, but
/// this caused issues with Dart's switch-case exhaustiveness checking:
///
/// ```dart
/// // With base mixins, this switch is NOT exhaustive:
/// switch (dataType) {
///   case StepsHealthDataType(): // ...
///   case WeightHealthDataType(): // ...
///   // ERROR: Must also handle ReadableHealthDataType, WriteableHealthDataType,
///   // SumAggregatableHealthDataType, etc., even though all instances are
///   // already covered by the concrete types above!
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The problem is that `mixin` with `base` makes mixins part of the sealed
/// type hierarchy, causing the analyzer to require handling them as separate
/// cases, even when they're already covered by concrete implementations.
///
/// ### Why Interface Classes?
///
/// Using `abstract interface class` solves this problem, as interfaces don't
/// participate in sealed type exhaustiveness checking, so you only need to
/// handle concrete types:
/// ```dart
/// switch (dataType) {
///   case StepsHealthDataType(): // ...
///   case WeightHealthDataType(): // ...
///   // No need to handle interface types!
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Trade-offs
///
/// The main trade-off is code duplication: each concrete type must implement
/// all methods from the interfaces it supports.
/// However, this is acceptable because:
/// - The implementations are straightforward (mostly creating request objects)
/// - It eliminates the switch-case exhaustiveness problem
