/// Base class for all health records.
///
/// ## Acknowledgments
///
/// **Android Health Connect SDK**
///
/// - The health record hierarchy design (HealthRecord → Interval/Instant/Series →
///   Specific Records) is inspired by the organizational structure of
///   the Android Health Connect SDK
/// - **Source**: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/health-connect
/// - **Documentation**: https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect
///
/// **Implementation Details:**
///
/// - All code in this file is an **original Dart implementation** written
///   specifically for Flutter
/// - No source code has been copied from Health Connect SDK (written in Kotlin/Java)
/// - The design follows functional organizational patterns that are
///   industry-standard for health data categorization
/// - This is a **cross-platform abstraction layer** designed for
///   interoperability between Android and iOS health platforms
