/// A health record representing a measurement at a single point in time.
///
/// ## Time Representation
///
/// ### Android (Health Connect)
/// - Single timestamp stored as "time"
/// - Timezone offset supported and preserved
/// - Instant records map to `InstantRecord` subclasses
///
/// ### iOS (HealthKit)
/// - Maps to HKQuantitySample or HKCategorySample
/// - Start and end dates are the same (point-in-time)
/// - Timezone information less explicit (uses device timezone)

sealed class InstantHealthRecord extends HealthRecord {
  /// Creates an instant health record at the specified [time].
  ///
  /// The [zoneOffsetSeconds] is optional and represents the timezone offset
  /// in seconds from UTC at the time of measurement.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// final record = WeightRecord(
  ///   time: DateTime.now(),
  ///   weight: Mass.kilograms(72.0),
  ///   metadata: Metadata.manualEntry(),
  /// );
  /// ```

  /// This represents the exact moment the health data was recorded or measured.

  /// The timezone offset in seconds at the time of measurement.
  ///
  /// This represents the offset from UTC at [time]:
  /// - Positive for timezones ahead of UTC (e.g., +3600 for UTC+1)
  /// - Negative for timezones behind UTC (e.g., -28800 for UTC-8)
  /// - Null if timezone information is not available
  ///
  /// **Platform differences:**
  /// - **Android (Health Connect):** Timezone offset fully supported
  /// - **iOS (HealthKit):** Timezone information less explicit, typically uses
  ///   device timezone
