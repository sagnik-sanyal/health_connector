/// A health record containing multiple data samples within a time interval.
///
/// ## Platform Behavior
///
/// ### Android (Health Connect)
/// - Native support for series records
/// - Maps to `SeriesRecord` subclasses
/// - Samples stored as part of the record
/// - Efficient bulk storage and retrieval
///
/// ### iOS (HealthKit)
/// - Series represented via `HKQuantitySeries` or multiple `HKQuantitySample`
/// - Less direct support compared to Android
/// - May require aggregation of individual samples
