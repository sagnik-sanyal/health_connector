/// Platform client interface for interacting with native health platforms.
///
/// This interface defines the contract for platform-specific implementations
/// that communicate with Health Connect (Android) or HealthKit (iOS) to read,
/// write, and manage health data.
///
/// Implementations of this interface handle:
/// - Permission management
/// - Reading and writing health records
/// - Aggregating health data
/// - Deleting health records
/// - Querying platform capabilities and features
@sinceV1_0_0

  /// Returns the current status of the health platform on the device,

  /// ## Returns
  ///
