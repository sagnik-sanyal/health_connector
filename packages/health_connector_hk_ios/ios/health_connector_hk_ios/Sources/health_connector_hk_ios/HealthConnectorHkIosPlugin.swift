    ///
    /// 1. **Unsafe memory access**: The `FlutterStandardWriter` writes to `NSMutableData`
    ///    while the Flutter engine may be reading/writing from the main thread.
    /// 2. **Flutter engine assumptions**: The Flutter engine expects platform channel
    ///    responses to arrive on the main thread (the thread where the engine runs).
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// Task {
    ///     let result = try await client.readRecords(request: request)
    ///     complete(completion, with: .success(result))
    /// }
